# Weekly-Project-9
This week, I challenged myself to create an app that communicates between an android phone a computer using the UDP protocol

The app, when complete, will act as a wireless trackpad for computers, allowing users to use their phones to control the mouse on screen.

This app utilizes the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to send commands via the internet from phone to laptop.

In it's current state, this can send onscreen positions, via textbox, to the computer. Currently I am working on figuring out the serverside, so a user can input the IP address of their machine into the mobile app while running the server program, and control their computer. At this point, I only have it working on university machines at Rutgers University. Additionally, the code for controlling the mouse has been excluded because I lack the permission on the university machines to install the Pynput Library.
